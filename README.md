# CodeSample
This repo contains a coding exercise parsing CIGAR strings in different transcripts. The detailed description and outline of the project is in `Invitae_Bioinformatics_Exercise_B.3.pdf`.

The main solution is in `InvitaeTech.py` and unittests are in `InvitaeTechTest.py`. Required input files for the unittests are `input1.tsv`, `input2.tsv` and `input1_invalid.tsv`.
I solved this in approximately three hours.
